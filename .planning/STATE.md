### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5 phases derived from 25 requirements; STRC/OUTP split across Phase 2 (types) and Phase 3 (metrics/output)
- [Roadmap]: Incremental mode (Phase 4) ordered before LLM enrichment (Phase 5) to prevent wasted API calls on unchanged files
- [Research]: MEAI (Microsoft.Extensions.AI) chosen for provider-agnostic LLM integration; Anthropic SDK beta risk contained to adapter layer

### Pending Todos

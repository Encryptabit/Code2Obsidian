# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-25)

**Core value:** A developer can point this tool at any C# solution and get an Obsidian vault that lets them understand what the code does, how it connects, and where the danger zones are -- without reading every file.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - CLI Foundation & Pipeline Architecture

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (CLI Foundation & Pipeline Architecture)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: Plan 01-01 complete, ready for 01-02
Last activity: 2026-02-26 -- Plan 01-01 executed (pipeline architecture extraction)

Progress: [#.........] 10%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 5 min
- Total execution time: 0.08 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 1 | 5 min | 5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (5 min)
- Trend: baseline

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Context]: Phase 1 success criterion #4 (backward compatibility) dropped — output format unconstrained during refactor
- [Roadmap]: 5 phases derived from 25 requirements; STRC/OUTP split across Phase 2 (types) and Phase 3 (metrics/output)
- [Roadmap]: Incremental mode (Phase 4) ordered before LLM enrichment (Phase 5) to prevent wasted API calls on unchanged files
- [Research]: MEAI (Microsoft.Extensions.AI) chosen for provider-agnostic LLM integration; Anthropic SDK beta risk contained to adapter layer
- [01-01]: Merged CallGraphAnalyzer into MethodAnalyzer to avoid double iteration over syntax trees
- [01-01]: Assembly name strings instead of IAssemblySymbol references for user-method filtering
- [01-01]: Per-method emission mode as default for Phase 1

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Anthropic C# SDK is in beta (12.4.0) -- monitor for breaking changes during Phase 5
